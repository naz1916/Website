<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>McLaren, a name synonymous with speed, luxury, and innovation, traces its origins to 1963 when it was founded by the legendary New Zealand racing driver, Bruce McLaren. The company emerged from humble beginnings, driven by a passion for racing and a relentless pursuit of performance.</p>
<p>McLaren's early years were marked by significant success in Formula 1. The team quickly established itself as a formidable force, winning numerous races and championships. The iconic McLaren F1 team, with drivers like Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, became a symbol of dominance in the sport.</p>
<p>Following a period of restructuring and rebranding, McLaren Automotive was established in 2010. The company focused on producing a range of high-performance sports cars and supercars, each embodying the McLaren DNA of speed, agility, and driver engagement.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">DISCUSSION</h2>
<h3 id="history">HISTORY</h3>
<p>Founded by Bruce McLaren in 1963, McLaren was on the path to building its first racecar in the first year. The first ever McLaren model was the McLaren M1A, which saw just 24 models produced. Later, the M1B emerged and entered the Can-Am championship, earning 43 victories and besting rival Porsche on the season. By 1965, McLaren had constructed their first Formula 1 entry, debuting at the legendary Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
<p>While years of racing success followed, McLaren founder Bruce McLaren was lost in a car accident in 1970, throwing the future of the company in doubt. By then, McLaren had established nearly a decade of winning traditions across both GT and Formula 1 racing, and had begun conceptualizing their first road car, the M6GT.</p>
<p>From Bruce's death in 1970, entrepreneur Teddy Mayer took the helm at McLaren, leading the team to their first World Constructor's championship in 1974. Driver Emerson Fittipaldi also earned McLaren their first Driver's championship in that same season. James Hunt then won for the team in 1976, however the next several years saw limited success for the McLaren Formula 1 program.</p>
<p>The trajectory of McLaren changed drastically when they merged with the Project 4 Racing Team run by Ron Dennis. This brought designer John Barnard back to the fold and introduced the use of carbon fiber composite materials in a race car for the first time. This car was known as the MP4/1, and it improved safety, rigidity, and performance across the board. Between 1984 and 1991, McLaren drivers won the Formula 1 world driver's championship seven times, with the 1988 season seeing the team take 15 victories in 16 races, leading all but 27 laps of the entire season.</p>
<p>During this time, McLaren set sights on creating their first-ever production car, with the legendary McLaren F1 debuting in 1992. Just 106 units were produced, and at the time it was the only road-legal vehicle capable of achieving over 200 miles per hour.</p>

    <h3>LANDO NORRIS</h3>
    <p>Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply.
    McLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1’s galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn’t let them down.
    </p>
    <p>Paired with the highly-rated – and far more experienced – Carlos Sainz, his rookie season was impressive, Norris edging the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points 11 times, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10 championship placing.
    A maiden podium came in 2020, with more following in the subsequent two seasons – he narrowly missed out on a win at Russia 2021 – as he dominated another more senior team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to firmly establish himself in F1’s top tier.
    </p>
    <p>Away from the track, Norris brims with a modest charm and an artistic side sees him design and paint his own race gear as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying artistry and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of youth to take them back to the top.
    Norris hopes the downforce will be with him…

    <h3>OSCAR PIASTRI</h3>
    <p>Born in Melbourne, just a stone’s throw away from the Australian Grand Prix venue, a young Oscar Piastri’s dreams of one day racing in Formula 1 were ignited by the sport’s star drivers roaring around his local streets, otherwise known as Albert Park.
        But it would take huge commitment and sacrifice to turn that dream into a reality, with a move to Europe – made by the likes of fellow countrymen Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo before him – the only way to go up against the best and 
        catch the attention of the sport’s decision-makers.</p>
    <p> Using success on the Australian karting scene as a springboard, Piastri continued to learn the craft in championships across Europe, before getting his first taste of single-seater competition as a 15-year-old – two podium finishes in F4 UAE a sign of things to come.
        From there, success flowed. British F4 runner-up. Formula Renault champion. F3 champion. F2 champion (by more than 50 points). Piastri did not simply climb the junior single-seater ladder, 
        he charged up it to knock loudly on the F1 door.</p>
    <p>So impressive was Piastri that two F1 teams squabbled over his services for 2023, adding a new dimension to the driver market and so-called ‘silly season’. McLaren, and not long-time backers Alpine, won out and their rookie repaid them in spades, 
        taking two podiums in a highly impressive debut campaign.</p>
